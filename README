				BURTE
                 Basic Universal Real Time Executive

BURTE V2.12 is a mini-kernel for the MC68332.  It was originally
written for the 68000 by Dan Christian, and ported to the 332 by
Andrew H. Fagg (ahfagg@robotics.usc.edu).

The code is mainly for historical purposes.  It hasn't been maintained
since 1995 and compiler standards have changed (e.g. there are actual
standards now).


This package comes with:
	BURTE V2.12 - kernel + libraries
	tpulib - a library for interfacing to the 332's Time Processor
Unit, written by Parag Batavia and Dan Spitzley.

See doc/ for general documentation and src/history for lower level
code changes.

Comments, questions, bug reports, and bug fixes are welcome (email to
ahfagg@robotics.usc.edu), but whether I will be able to respond in a
reasonable amount of time remains to be seen.
