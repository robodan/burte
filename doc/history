V1.01	First version of BURTE in ROM


V1.10	10-April-88	Dan Christian
	Fixed bug in set baud rate.
	Speeded up serial drivers.
	Added a ready process queue to speed up the scheduler.  Burte
in RAM can now handle 9600 baud transparent mode without sending XOFF.
However, it isn't quite fast enough when in ROM.
	Programmers button is on both interupts 4 and 6.  The timer
should be moved to level 6.  The programmers button can be on level 4
without many problems.  It won't be able to interupt device drivers
though.


V1.11	9-May-88	Dan Christian
	Changed download.c to allow S1-S9 records.
	Changed the dload command to allow the entire command line to
be specified.

V2.00   5-May-92	Andrew H. Fagg
	Ported to MC68332 processor.
	Added msleep(), sleep(), set_schedule_interval(),
next_interval(), super_inp(), and super_outp() system calls. 

V2.10   3-March-93	Andrew H. Fagg
	Added supervisor() system call.
	Set wallclock to operate at a 122 usec period.
	Added the statistics and wait shell commands.

V2.11			Andrew H. Fagg
	Added super_outb(), and super_inb() calls.

V2.12
