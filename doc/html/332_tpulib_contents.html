TPU Initialization functions:</H3> <P>

	These functions set up the individual TPU channels to perform one of
5 functions and are generally called at the beginning of the users 
initialization routine. The functions available are:
<UL>

<LI> 	Discrete Input/Output (DIO):  			tpu_dio()
<LI> 	Pulse Width Modulation (PWM): 			tpu_pwm()
<LI> 	Synchronized Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM):	tpu_spwm()
<LI> 	Input Transition Counter (ITC):			tpu_itc()
<LI> 	Period/Pulse Width Accumulator (PPWA):		tpu_ppwa()
</UL>
 <P>
	To use the functions in raw (burte-less) mode, you must link
in librawtpu.a. An example Makefile which uses the tpu libraries and
is set up for 332 compiling in general can be found in
/home/mensa/handsys/332new/src/tpulib/
 <P>

<H3>
TPU Support Functions:</H3> <P>

	These functions are ancillary to the Initialization functions, and 
allow the user to dynamically change the operational parameters of the TPU
functions. They can be called at any time in the user's program. The functions 
available are:
<UL>


<LI> 	DIO Support Functions: 	 <BR>
DIO_set_match_rate(int channel, int rate) <BR>
				DIO_read_req(int channel) <BR>
				DIO_read_channel(int channel) <BR>
				DIO_force_high(int channel) <BR>
				DIO_force_low(int channel)  <P>

<LI> 	PWM Support Functions: <BR>	PWM_update_channel(int channel, int pwmhi) <BR>
				PWM_update_pwmper(int channel, int pwmper) <P>

<LI> 	ITC Support Functions:  <BR> ITC_set_max_cnt(int maxcnt) <P>

<LI> 	SPWM Support Functions:	 <BR>SPWM_set_hightime(int channel, int spwmhi) <BR>
				SPWM_set_period(int channel, int spwmper) <BR>
				SPWM_set_ref_parms(int channel, short ref1,
						   short ref2) <BR>
				SPWM_set_delay(int channel, int delay) <P>

<LI> 	PPWA Support Functions: <BR>	PPWA_set_accum_rate(int channel, int rate) <BR>
				PPWA_set_max_cnt(int channel, int maxcnt) <BR>
				PPWA_get_pulse(int channel)  <P>
	
<LI> 	General I/O Functions: <BR>	inp(short address)	(defined as a macro) <BR>
				inb(short address)	(defined as a macro) <BR>
				outp(short address, int value) <BR>
				outb(short address, short value) <P>
</UL>
