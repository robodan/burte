<TITLE>TPULIB Function call examples</TITLE>
<H2>Descriptions and Example Calls for Initialization Functions:</H2> <P>

	Each initialization function requires a channel specification,
a priority level, a Time base/directionality (TBS) value, and an
interrupt status value.  Functions may also require a Pin Action
Control (PAC) value, a Pin State Control (PSC) value, and/or a host
sequence code. <P>
<UL>

<LI> 	channel: An integer from 0 to 15 associated with the desired pin for
		 the function to perform on.  <BR>

<LI> 	priority: Either HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW as defined in the header file
		  "tpulib.h". A HIGH priority guarantees 4 out of every 7 time 
		  slots, at least 2 out of every 7 time slots for MEDIUM 
		  priority, and at least 1 out of every 7 time slots for LOW 
		  priority. <BR>

<LI> 	int_status: Determines whether to enable or disable the function's
		    ability to generate a CPU interrupt. Value is either 
		    ENABLE or DISABLE as defined in the header file "tpulib.h". <BR>

<LI> 	PSC: For functions which can be used as outputs, the value of the PSC
	     can be used to force the pin to a certain state.  <BR>

<LI> 	PAC: Specifies transition edge to detect on input channels. On output
	     channels it specifies high or low logic level to output as a 
	     result of a match. <BR>

<LI> 	TBS: Designates a channel as input or output. Also specifies the time
	     base (TCR1 and TCR2) for the input capture and output compare 
	     functions on each channel. <BR>

<LI> 	host sequence: Specifies the mode of operation to be used for the 
	     function on a channel. <BR>

</UL>
<P>
	Each of the required values must be clearly stated in the
function call. The values which must be passed to each function and
descriptions of the meanings of these values follow.
 <P>

<H4>tpu_dio(channel, priority, TBS, PAC, host_sequence, int_status);</H4> <P>

	The tpu_dio() function initializes a channel to emulate a
discrete input or output function. The parameter PIN_LEVEL in the TPU
holds the 16 most recent pin states, 15 being the most recent and 0
being the least.  The two modes of operation provide discrete input:
transition mode and match mode.  The CPU can update PIN_LEVEL at any
time. <P>
<PRE>

		DIO_TCR1 	 - Capture TCR1, Match TCR1
		DIO_TCR1_TCR2 	 - Capture TCR1, Match TCR2
		DIO_TCR2_TCR1 	 - Capture TCR2, Match TCR1
		DIO_TCR2 	 - Capture TCR2, Match TCR2
		DIO_NOCHANGE_TBS - Do not change TBS

	PAC - There are 5 PAC options available:
		DIO_NOTRANS 	 - Do not detect transition
		DIO_RISING 	 - Detect rising edge
		DIO_FALLING 	 - Detect falling edge
		DIO_EITHER 	 - Detect either edge

	host_sequence - There are 3 host_sequence modes available:
		DIO_TRANSMODE	 - Record Pin on Transition. Places pin sample
				   in PIN_LEVEL in the TPU.

</PRE>

 <P>
Example calls: <P>

	1. tpu_dio(0, HIGH, DIO_TCR1, DIO_NOTRANS, DIO_RECORD_HSR11, DISABLE); <P>

	This call will set up TPU 0 as a DIO input. The value on the
DIO pin will be read into the PIN_LEVEL register whenever the user
asserts a HSR 11 by calling DIO_read_req(channel). The value, '0' or '1',
can then be read by issuing a DIO_read_channel(channel).  <P>

	2. tpu_dio(0, HIGH, DIO_NOCHANGE_TBS, DIO_NOCHANGE_PAC, DIO_TRANSMODE,
		   DISABLE); <P>

	This call will set up TPU 0 as DIO output. The value of TPU 0 can be
changed by calling force_high(channel) to set it to '1', or force_low(channel)
to set it to '0'.  <P>

<H4>tpu_pwm(channel, priority, TBS, PSC, int_status);</H4>

	The tpu_pwm() function initializes a channel to generate a
pulse-width-modulated waveform where the period and/or high time can
be changed at any time by the CPU. <P>
<PRE>

	TBS - There are 3 TBS options available:
		PWM_TCR1 	 - Capture TCR1, Compare TCR1
		PWM_TCR2 	 - Capture TCR2, Compare TCR2
		PWM_NOCHANGE_TBS - Do not change TBS

	PSC - There are 4 PSC options available:
		PWM_FORCE_BY_LATCHES - Force pin as specifief by PAC latches
		PWM_FORCE_HIGH	     - Force pin high
		PWM_FORCE_LOW	     - Force pin low
		PWM_NOFORCE	     - Do not force any state

</PRE>

Example call: <P>

	1. tpu_pwm(3, MEDIUM, PWM_TCR1, PWM_NOFORCE, DISABLE); <P>

	This call will assign channel 3 to output a PWM signal, which can be
used to drive futaba servos. The period and the high time of the signal are
set by PWM_update_pwmper(channel, per), and PWM_update_channel(channel, pwmhi),
respectively. See the support section for more details.  <P>

<H4>tpu_itc(channel, priority, TBS, PAC, host_sequence, int_status)</H4> <P>


	The tpu_itc() function initializes a channel to perform an
input capture on a specified transition and/or count the number of
input capture events caused by input transitions. <P>
<PRE>

	TBS - There are 2 TBS options available:
		ITC_TCR1 - Capture TCR1
		ITC_TCR2 - Capture TCR2

	PAC - There are 5 PAC options available:
		ITC_NOTRANS 	 - Do not detect transition
		ITC_RISING 	 - Detect rising edge
		ITC_FALLING 	 - Detect falling edge
		ITC_EITHER 	 - Detect either edge
		ITC_NOCHANGE_PAC - Do not change PAC

	host_sequence - There are 4 host_sequence options available:
		ITC_NOLINK_SINGLE - No Link, Single Mode
				    Performs transition count once
		ITC_NOLINK_CONT   - No Link, Continuous Mode
				    Performs transition count continuously
		ITC_LINK_SINGLE   - Link, Single Mode
		ITC_LINK_CONT     - Link, Continuous mode

</PRE>
 <P>
Example call: <P>

	1. tpu_itc(1, HIGH, ITC_TCR1, ITC_RISING, ITC_NOLINK_CONT, ENABLE); <P>

	This call will set up TPU 1 as an interrupt transition counter. The
TPU will generate an interrupt to the CPU on the rising edge of the input 
signal. By setting the max_cnt parameter with ITC_set_max_cnt(channel, cnt),
the TPU can be intstructed only to interrupt the CPU on every cnt occurence of
the specified transition. See the support functions section for more details. <P>

<H4>tpu_ppwa(channel, priority, TBS, PAC, host_sequence, int_status)</H4> <P>

	The tpu_ppwa() function allows a TPU pin to measure the period
and/or pulse width of an input signal. This can be used for
pulse-width modulation input, such as from a futaba transmitter, or
frequency measurement. <P>
<PRE>

	TBS - 5 options available:
		PPWA_TCR1	- capture and match w/ TCR1
		PPWA_TCR1_TCR2	- capture TCR1, match TCR2
		PPWA_TCR2_TCR1 	- capture TCR2, match TCR1

	PAC - 2 options available:
		PPWA_RISING	- Accumulate high time of a signal (PWM)
		PPWA_FALLING 	- Accumulate during entire period of a signal
				  (frequency)

	host_sequence - 2 options available:
		PPWA_24_BIT_PER - 24 bit period accumulate
		PPWA_24_BIT_PW	- 24 bit high time accumulate

</PRE>
 <P>
Example call: <P>

	1. tpu_ppwa(1, HIGH, PPWA_TCR1, PPWA_RISING, PPWA_24_BIT_PW, DIABLE); <P>

	Calling tpu_ppwa with these parameters set up channel 1 to read the
PWM input from a futaba PWM transmitter. After the initilization call, the
accumulation rate and the number of periods to count must be set. The 
accumulation rate is set by calling PPWA_set_accum_rate(channel, rate), and
the number of pulses to count is set by calling PPWA_set_max_cnt(channel, cnt).
See the support function section for more details.  <P>

<H4>tpu_spwm(channel, priority, TBS, PSC, host_sequence, int_status)</H4> <P>

	The tpu_spwm() function generates a pwm signal which is synchronized
by channel linking to another spwm signal. This can be used to generate a 
start waveform, followed by additional signals after a certain time, based on
the beginning of the original waveform. <P>
<PRE>

	TBS - 3 options:
		SPWM_TCR1	- capture and compare w/ TCR1
		SPWM_TCR2 	- capture and compare w/ TCR2
