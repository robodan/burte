<H4>DIO Support functions:</H4>
<PRE>

void DIO_set_match_rate(int channel, int rate)

	This sets the match rate of the DIO pin, so that it is updated at
regular intervals. This should be used with TCR1, as when TCR2 is used, it
is not cleared to 0 at initilization, so the first sample isn't after
"rate" clock pulses. TCR1 is cleared, however. The rate is an int, which
determines after how many TCR1/2 clock pulses the pin should be sampled.

short DIO_read_channel(int channel)
		
	This function returns either a 0 or 1, based on the value on 
channel. If used in update at HSR11 mode, DIO_read_req() should be called 
first. 

void DIO_read_req(int channel)

	This function issues a request to read the status of the specified
channel. It should only be used if the channel was originally set up to 
update when a HSR11 is issued.

void DIO_force_high(int channel)

	This function forces a DIO to a logic '1'.

void DIO_force_low(int channel)

	This function forces a DIO to a logic '0'.
</PRE>

<H4>ITC Support functions:</H4>
<PRE>

void ITC_set_max_cnt(int channel, int maxcnt)

	This function is called to set the number of transitions that the
ITC should gather before generating an interrupt. If the interrupts are 
disabled, calling this function has no effect. 


</PRE>

<H4>PWM Support functions:</H4>
<PRE>

void PWM_update_pwmper(int channel, int pwmper)

	This function is called to set the period, or frequency, of the 
PWM. pwmper is measured in terms of system clock cycles, and the lowest 
recommended value is 32. The maximum usable value is one which satisfies the
equation pwmper-pwmhi <= 0x8000.

void PWM_update_channel(int channel, int pwmhi)

	This function sets the high time of a PWM output. Valid values are 
between 0 and > pwmper. 0 sets the channel to logic '0', while a value 
higher than the period sets it to logic '1'. Any value inbetween is taken
as a proportion of the pwmper time. Therefore a pwmhi = 1/2 of pwmper will
deliver a 50% duty cycle. 

</PRE>

<H4>PPWA Support functions:</H4>
<PRE>
void PPWA_set_accum_rate(int channel, int value)

	This function sets the accum rate for a PPWA input. The formula for 
calculating the input is that the rate = 1/(rate * resolution of TCR used). 
When using a futaba transmitter as input, 0x20 is a good value to use.

void PPWA_set_max_cnt(int channel, int cnt)

	This function sets the number of pulses over which the period or high
time is accumulated. For a futaba transmitter, 1 is used. 

unsigned PPWA_get_pulse(int channel)

	This function returns the pulse width or period length of the PWM
input signal. Generally, when used with the futaba servos, values between
600 and 1000 are returned.

<H4>SPWM Support functions:</H4>
<PRE>

void SPWM_set_hightime(channel, high)

void SPWM_set_period(channel, high)

void SPWM_set_ref_parms(channel, addr1, addr2)

void SPWM_set_delay(channel, delay)

</PRE>
