<H4>1.  Compiling programs</H4>

	Because the 68332 is (almost) a 68000-compatible processor, we
are utilizing the gnu-C cross-compiler on the sparcs.  The libraries are
adapted from a kernel called BURTE (Basic Universal Real Time Environment),
which is also currently up and running on the 332.  <P>
	The libraries and BURTE code can be found in ~handsys/332new/burte,
while the compiler is located in /home/mensa/local/bin. /home/mensa/local/bin
should be at the beginning of your path so that the cross compiler can be 
used. The cross-compiler is automatically invoked whenever -target sun3 is
used as the first command line option.  <P>
	There are two ways to create new programs - direct mode, and BURTE
mode. While there aren't many code differences, different makefiles are 
required. Sample makefiles for both modes can be found in  
<A HREF="/home/mensa/handsys/332new/src/sample/">~handsys/332new/src/sample</A>. Gcc is called to create the object files, and 
gld is used to link the code to an executable. In non-BURTE mode, all object
files start at location 0x3000, while is BURTE mode, they start at 0xA000.
	All programs must include "userstart.o" as the first file to be linked.
There are two versions - one for BURTE, and one w/out. The one for BURTE is
automatically linked in w/ the sample Makefile. The non-BURTE version can 
be found in ~handsys/332new/src/sample.  <P>
	After linking, this "executable" file is then passed through a 
program called dl68, which creates an S-record format file of the program.  
It is this file that is downloaded to the 68332 board (the extension is .dl). <P>
 <P>

<H4>2.  Downloading and running programs w/out BURTE</H4> <P>

	The 68332 can be connected to /dev/ttya and /dev/ttyb on mensa, and
/dev/ttyb on kobra. With ~handsys/bin added to your path, you will have 
access to cona/b and dlpa/b which allow you to connect to and download software
to the '332. If the '332 is connected to /dev/ttya, then cona must be used,
else conb must be used. The con program calls kermit up, and connects you to
the 332DEBUG monitor on the BCC. The '332 then can be told to get ready to
accept a program, and then dlp can be used to download it. The steps are as
follows:  <P>
<UL>
<LI> 		1.  Type "con[a][b]", which will connect you to the 332.  
			Hitting <return> a couple of times should yield a 
			332Bug> prompt. If not, then hit the reset switch on 
			the board.  At the prompt, type "lo<RETURN>", then
			"<CTRL>\c" to escape out of the con program. <P>
<LI> 		2.  At the unix prompt, type "dlpa[b] <prognam.dl>".  This 
			program will print a series of dots, representing
			each S-record that is sent.  Control will then
			be returned to the unix shell. <P>
<LI> 		3.  Type "con" again and hit <return> a few times to
			get the 332Bug> prompt back.  It is possible
			to verify the transfer by then repeating 
			steps 2 - 4, except that "ve" is used instead
			of "lo". This is not usually required.  <P>
<LI> 		4.  The program may now be run by typing "g".  When
			the program is complete, the user is returned
			to the 332Bug> prompt. <P> <P>
</UL>

It is possible that a program will occasionally halt w/out returning to the
332BUG prompt or providing any indication of why it failed. This is fairly
rare now that the system has been tested and debugged, but it still sometimes
happens. In order to track down such a problem, it is necessary for the 
programmer to narrow down the bug by: <P>
<UL>
<LI> 	1.  Using "qprintf()" to best identify where the program stops
		behaving as desired. <P>
<LI> 	2.  Attempt to reduce the program down to a minimum set of conditions
		that cause the bug (a 4-line program is easier to work
		with in assembly than is a 100-line program).  This is
		very important and may affect how quickly the bug gets
		fixed. <P>
<LI> 	3.  Send mail to ahfagg@pollux or parag@mensa with a pointer to 
		the various programs and a description of the problem.   <P>
</UL>


<H4>3.  What is currently available. </H4><P>
<UL>
<LI> 	Math routines for integers. 
<LI> 	low-level i/o routines (putchar, getchar, etc). 
<LI> 	qprintf() and associated routines (much faster than printf, but
		does not do floating point). 
<LI> 	string handling routines (strlen, strcmp, etc).
<LI> 	printf() is partially working, where floating point numbers are
		not used.
<LI> 	scanf() should work for integers and characters, but it hasn't
		been tried. Use getint() instead to read integers. 
<LI> 	High-level libraries for most TPU functions. 
<LI> 	Limited support for floating point operations using a 68881 
		co-processor. Send mail to monty@mensa for details.
